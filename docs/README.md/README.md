# Root README Explained

## Purpose
The top-level `README.md` is the front door to the repository. It introduces Kurzlernen as “Static website with interactive educational pages” and hints that the site is deployed with GitHub Pages. Simple, but mighty: this one sentence sets the expectation for newcomers who open the repo on GitHub.

## Why keep it short?
From first principles, a README needs to answer three questions quickly: What is this? Can I use it? Where is it hosted? The existing text answers all three in a single breath. The GitHub UI already surrounds the file with repo metadata (stars, issues, license), so a succinct description avoids redundancy and lets curious readers dive straight into the code or the new per-file READMEs in this `docs/` folder.

## When to update it
- **New flagship features** → Add a quick teaser so visitors know what’s new.
- **Deployment changes** → If the hosting platform or workflow changes, mention it here.
- **Onboarding links** → Link to documentation, issue templates, or the most popular interactive demos.

## Make it sparkle
Want a tiny challenge? Try rewriting the root README in exactly three sentences: one for the vision, one for the technology, one for how to explore. That micro exercise keeps the message crisp and forces us to focus on what matters most.

In short: the root `README.md` is a minimalist lobby. The detailed guided tours live in the neighboring rooms you’re reading right now.
