# Story Hub Landing Page (yourstories.de)

## Essence
`yourstories.de` is a one-page marketing site for a storytelling service. It shares DNA with `geschichte.html` but is tailored as an external landing page with bold hero sections, feature highlights, pricing, testimonials, and a closing call-to-action.

## Anatomy
1. **Navbar** – Minimal top bar with “Preise” and “Jetzt starten” buttons that scroll to sections using anchor links.
2. **Hero** – Full-screen background pattern, giant headline, and dual call-to-action buttons. Content centers around Christian Hohlfeld’s storytelling craft and AI voice synthesis.
3. **Feature grid** – Cards introduce benefits like premium AI voices, personal Betreuung, and flexible Abos.
4. **Pricing section** – Three packages (Einzelkauf, Monatsabo, Autoren-Paket) with checkmarks and animated hover scale.
5. **Testimonials** – Carousel-like list of satisfied clients with avatars and quotes.
6. **CTA section** – Encourages immediate sign-up with another button set and supportive copy.
7. **Footer** – Contact details and legal links for a professional finish.

## Experience principles
- Tailwind + DaisyUI deliver responsive design without manual CSS heavy lifting.
- Typography uses the Inter font family to keep everything crisp and modern.
- Utility classes power subtle animations (hover scaling, box shadows) to guide the eye.

## Ideas for customization
- Hook the CTA buttons to your CRM or scheduling app by changing the `href` attributes.
- Add analytics by inserting a `<script>` tag near the end; the layout already includes clear conversion points.
- Translate the text to other languages or adjust the theme colors by modifying the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

This page is a polished storytelling sales pitch: it frames the problem, showcases the solution, and invites the reader to act.
